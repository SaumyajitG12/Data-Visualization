Prediction vs Forecast

Annova - Analysis of Variance
Degree of Freedom -> Total No of Values -1
F-Statistic : Regression sum of square vs regular sum of squares

Similarity : Break point towards the future
Prediction : Done using regression i.e., predicting value of dependant variable using value of one or more dependant variable
Forecast : Done on Time Series to predict the value of next time period i.e., trying to forecast some value in the future.

Forecasting: 

Additive, Adds up the T C S I in some way
Multipliative, multiplies the T C S I in some way

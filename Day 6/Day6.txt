Filters in Tableau -

1. Data Source filter   \
2. Dimension filter      \
3. Measure Filter         \_______ These performs the same function as where clause.
4. Date filter            /        Context filter is very important as an interview question. 
5. Top/Bottom filter     /         So is top/bottom.
6. Context filter       /

Any filter that is applied at the data source is called Data Source Filter. Modifies the no and type of record going into tableau at the source.

When you have top/bottom filter is applied with another top/bottom filter it always throws an error. This is because there is no order of execution
to top/bottom filters.
This is where context filters come in

Make sure the top filter is added to context.

Whenever you add a context filter, that filter gets executed first. And the background color chages to grey to show it is the more important filter.
The context filter gets applied first, and then the other top/bottom/other filters get executed. This gives us the correct results.

Sets are aso a part of tableau, sets work on the concept of set theory where a member is in or out.

Group vs Set
------------
Group can be created on measure or dimension  |  Set cannot be created on measure
Group is not used as a filter                 |  Set can be used as a filter
Group is used to logically group elements     |  Set is used to define if elements are part of set or not

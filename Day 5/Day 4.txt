Relation is the connection between two tables, Joins is the process of connecting two tables based on a relation.

Scatter Plot is used to get correlation between 2 quantitative or numeric variables

3 Types of correlation :

1: Positive :	The 2 variables affect each other positively, i.e., when one increase so does the other
2: Negetive :	The 2 variables are inversely correlated i.e, when one increases the other decreases
3: Neutral  :	The 2 variables are unaffected by each other

Y variable -> Dependant Variable
X Variable -> Independant Variable

With X we can predict the value of Y

Sales vs Profit(Scatter) 
------------------------
P-value:	< 0.0001
Equation:	Profit=0.173394*Sales+-14.1291

Coefficients
Term	Value	StdErr	t-value	p-value
Sales	0.173394	0.0013809	125.57	< 0.0001
intercept	-14.1291	0.754398	-18.729	< 0.0001

1. Using above equation, predict the profit for sales above 25000.
Profit : 4320.7209 [0.173394*25000+-14.1291]

2. Using above equation, predict the profit for sales above 25000.
Profit : 4320.8943 [0.173394*25001+-14.1291]
| | | | | | | | 
V V V V V V V V      
Slope 0.1733 means that for every 1 unit increase in sales profit increases by 0.1733 units

2. How much sales is required to achieve profit of 4800 : 27,764.1043




r^2 -> Co-Efficient of Determination (Shows how strong the correlation between x and y) [Minimum value is 0 and max is 1]
r^2 (.23) means 23% variations in the dependant variable profit can be explained by variation in Sales independant variable
Remaining 77% variations can be due to unknown reasons.
[r^2 is poor] Only 23% confidence means poor
Ideal r^2 is at least 70% or above
For some industries like space, r^2of 95%+ is expected.

Scatter Plots ARE NOT GOOD FOR discrete plots : More suitable for continuous data

Gerographic Charts -
1. Symbol
2. Solid (Choropleth)

Geograpic data is plotted using 2 values, Latitude and Longitude

Box & Whisker Plot : Used to find out data points that are outliers i.e., data that is away from the normal data
It comes from the field of astronomy

IQR : Inter Quartile Range
IRQ = Q3-Q1 [Quartile 3 - Quartile 1]
UW=Q3+(1.5* IQR)
LW=Q1-(1.5*1.5)

ANy values that are more that 1.5 IQR away from Q3 and Q1 are classified as outliers
*Whenever you dont have any value above UW your highest value becomes UW
*Whenever you dont have any value below LW your lowest value becomes LW
